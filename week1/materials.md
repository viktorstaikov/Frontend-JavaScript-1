# Materials for Week 1

[Be sure to check materials for week 0 first.](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Frontend-JavaScript-1/blob/master/week0/materials.md)

## HTML, CSS and Bootstrap

To avoid headaches from writing custom CSS, we are going to use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

Here are few very useful tools for Bootstrap:

* [Bootstrap button generator](http://www.plugolabs.com/twitter-bootstrap-button-generator/)
* [Bootstrap form builder](http://minikomi.github.io/Bootstrap-Form-Builder/)
* [Bootstrap layout builder](http://www.layoutit.com/)

### Videos ot watch

* Here is a good introduction to HTML 5 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siOHh0uzcuY - covering the stuff we are going to use.

## JavaScript The Good Parts

* The difference between `var f = function() {}` and `function f() {}` is explained very well here - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/336859/var-functionname-function-vs-function-functionname

## JavaScript, DOM and Frontend Programming

* A very good reference about the DOM can be found here - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM
* A short read about JavaScript and the DOM API - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/JavaScript_technologies_overview

We are going to use jQuery for our DOM manipulations.

There is no better way to start with jQuery than this - http://try.jquery.com/

The first topic is fast so try to cover the 12 videos from "Introduction to jQuery"
